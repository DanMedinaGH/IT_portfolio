# Office 365 User Creation

We can add a user to our organization in the Office 365 admin center. We go to:

## Creation 

```Users > Active users > Add a user```

Here we'll be prompted to add basic personal information.

Next, we'll assign a license to our new user.

Now we can add apps associated with the license to our user.

After, we can add a role the user if they are managing or adminstering any services.

If we plan on creating a person with the same settings in the future, then we save them as a template.

Our new user should now appear in the Active users section!
