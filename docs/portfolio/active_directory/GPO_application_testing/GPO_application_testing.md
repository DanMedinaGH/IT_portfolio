# GPO Application and Testing
In this project we will be applying and testing GPOs in our domain.

**Group Policy** are security rules and configuration settings for users and computers.

**GPOs** or **group policy objects** are used to apply group policy to users and computers.

## Operating Systems
- Windows 11 (x86-64)
- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows Server 2022 (x86-64)

## Environments and Technologies Used
- VMware Workstation Pro for Personal Use (Windows)

## GPO Application and Testing
To apply and test our GPOs we created and configured in [GPO Creation and Configuration](../GPO_creation_configuration/GPO_creation_configuration.md), we must first create user accounts **Windows 11 Pro** or **Windows 10 Enterprise**.

We will use [Windows 10 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-10-enterprise/).
