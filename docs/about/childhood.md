Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963,[24][25] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr..[25][26] He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[27][28] Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist.[29]

In 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina.[30] Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short.[31][32] Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[31] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[32] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[33] He also adopted his signature jersey number, 23.[34] As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[35][36] after averaging 26.8 ppg,[33] 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season.[37]

Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, Virginia, and Clemson.[38][39] He reportedly most strongly considered recruiting efforts from North Carolina, NC State, and Maryland before, in 1980,[39] he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[40] He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist.
